    The best and only planner a hard worker will EVER need(if you only work 9-5...). Not only can you write AND save all the important things you need to do during the WHOLE day(9-5) but this magical planner even lets you know the time down to the nearest hour! WOW!

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project I combined my extensive(a little bit limited actually) knowledge of CSS, HTML and Javascript to make a super effective and still simple to use workday planner to help people remember all the things they need to get during the day.
